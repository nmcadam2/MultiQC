Not sure how well my attempts at making it like usable in other peoples directories went but it works on mine! :) I tried to follow the conventions I've seen in class but like this might be a mess. Good luck!
For reference my file structure when I made this and ran it sucessfully was...

/scratch365/nmcadam2/MultiQC/input_data
/scratch365/nmcadam2/MultiQC/Run_MultiQC.sh
/scratch365/nmcadam2/MultiQC/README

To run place fastq files in input data. Then bash Run_MultiQC.sh. 
This will perform fastqc on all input files then install the Multiqc container in a directory named image. Multiqc will then be ran on all fastqc outputs to generate a single report.
